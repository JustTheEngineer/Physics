# Mathematics
## A geo-cache challenge - GC251EZ
My neighbor is into that geo-caching stuff, and he also knows I like the occasional math riddle, so he comes to me with stuff like this. 

The accompanying video is called [Throwing stones in Germany](https://youtu.be/OIIdSYQqluc "Throwing stones in Germany"), because it involves throwing a stone in Germany somewhere. Sounds logical, right? It's a basic physics problem about motion. Mr. Newton would have liked it. 

I like to use a CAS called maxima. CAS stands for Computer Algebra System. It's free and quite powerful. And it's a great tool to use if you study math or physics. 
(Maxima: https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima/ en wxMAxima: http://wxmaxima-developers.github.io/wxmaxima/). So you have the PDF file and the wxMaxima file here.
